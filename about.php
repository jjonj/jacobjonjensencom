			<h2>About Jacob Jon Jensen</h2>
			<p><img class="photo" src="../images/jacob1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
			<p>
			I'm a Danish Computer Science student at Aalborg University. Programming have been an interrest of mine since i was 16, 
			where i got started with doing modification to games, also inspired from my cousin who was a computer magician to me
			in my younger days. From there it was on a fast track to where i am now; programming in Languages such as C#, C, C++, 
			Java, Python, PHP/Javascript and previously VB, a list that i'm always looking to expand.
			</p>
			<p>My spare time is spent on personal programming projects, games such
			as Starcraft II (Great passion of mine), League of Legends and occasionally other games that pop up, TV Series and of course the obligatory Friends & Family.
			</p>
			<p>
			I have an interrest in many other fields aswell, such as movies, technology, advanced physics, philosophy, social 
			science, fantasy lore, world politics/trouble/climate, lucid dreaming and much more...
